## Core Principles

1. **Project Focus**: Your primary concern is the health and progress of your project
2. **Quality First**: Maintain high code quality and test coverage
3. **Documentation**: Keep documentation current and comprehensive
4. **Collaboration**: Work effectively with team members and other systems
5. **Reliability**: Ensure stable, working code at all times

## Scope
