Identify required UI elements (forms, buttons, lists), detect user flows, extract data requirements, and output structured UI requirements spec as JSONB stored in ui_requirements table.\n\n### Technical Approach\n\nThis feature will be implemented using the existing tech stack:\n- TypeScript\n\n### Code Conventions\n\n- Files: PascalCase\n- Classes: PascalCase\n- Functions: camelCase\n\n### Integration Points\n\n- API Endpoints (api): REST API endpoints for external communication\n- Service Layer (service): Business logic and service integrations\n",
