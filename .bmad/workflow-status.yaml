      Comprehensive Cloudflare tunnel management for meta-supervisor.
      - Tunnel health monitoring (30s interval)
      - Auto-restart on failure with exponential backoff
      - Multi-domain CNAME management (all domains in account)
      - Docker network intelligence (localhost vs container routing)
      - PS self-service CNAME requests via MCP tools
      - Automated ingress rule management
      - State tracking and audit logging
      - PortManager integration for validation

      Enables PS autonomy for service deployments.

# Notes and Context
notes: |
  Meta-project: Supervisor system managing itself.

  Current focus: Set up systematic tracking instead of ad-hoc changes.

  Key insight: The supervisor system needs the same rigor it applies to
  other projects. We're "eating our own dog food."

  Benefits:
  - Track what improvements actually work
  - Measure supervisor effectiveness
  - Share learnings systematically
  - Prevent regression
