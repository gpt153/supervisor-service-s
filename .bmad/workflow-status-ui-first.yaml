  architecture:
    status: pending
    outputs: []
    notes: |
      ADRs to be created during implementation:
      - Frame0 vs Figma as default design method
      - Mock data strategy (hardcoded vs Faker vs MSW)
      - Deployment architecture (Storybook + dev env)
      - Shared CNAME with path-based routing

  implementation:
    status: pending

# Estimated Timeline
timeline:
  total_hours: 120.5
  total_days: 15 (based on 8-hour days)
  estimated_completion: 2026-02-06 (assuming start 2026-01-23)
  notes: |
    Epics can be parallelized:
    - Epic UI-003 and UI-004 (design methods) can run in parallel
    - Epic UI-006 and UI-007 (deployments) can run after design epics complete

# Progress Metrics
metrics:
  epics_completed: 0
  epics_total: 9
  completion_percentage: 0
  estimated_remaining_hours: 120.5

# Key Decisions
decisions:
  - decision: Shared CNAME (ui.153.se) with path-based routing
    rationale: Single DNS entry for all UI tooling, clean URL structure
    date: 2026-01-22

  - decision: Two-track approach (design system + feature mockups)
    rationale: Reusable components (design system) + temporary mockups (feature)
    date: 2026-01-22

  - decision: Frame0 as default, Figma as fallback
    rationale: Frame0 faster for mockups, Figma for production-quality designs
    date: 2026-01-22

  - decision: Optional UI design phase (not mandatory gate)
    rationale: Flexibility - UI can be designed before, during, or after backend
    date: 2026-01-22

  - decision: Requirements-driven design (100% AC coverage)
    rationale: Ensure nothing missed from acceptance criteria
    date: 2026-01-22

# Risks
risks:
  - risk: Frame0 designs may not match expectations
    probability: medium
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Support iteration, Figma fallback

  - risk: Mock data may not be realistic enough
    probability: low
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Use Faker.js, domain templates

  - risk: Port conflicts across projects
    probability: low
    impact: high
    mitigation: Use project-specific port ranges, validation

  - risk: nginx config errors break all UI tools
    probability: low
    impact: high
    mitigation: Validate config before reload, backup config

# Next Steps
next_steps:
  - Start Epic UI-001: Requirements Analysis Engine
  - Create ADRs during implementation
  - Set up integration tests
  - Document PS guides for UI workflow
